### The Strategy
0. Check CryptoCat videos - it's a good intro. I don't have to understand everything here right now
1. Course https://github.com/RPISEC/MBE
2. Collect questions
3. If the question concearns assembly - check Arch1001
4. Question about memory or bin - check binary analysis or computer systems
5. Check tools and examples from kpi slides
6. Read binary analysis
