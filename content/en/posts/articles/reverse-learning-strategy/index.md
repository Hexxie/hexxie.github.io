description: I've created a strategy for myself to learn reverse engineering
---
## The Goal
- Getting myself familiar (better) in assembler (Intel and ARM).  
- Learn techniques to analyse easy binaries.


## The Strategy
0. Check CryptoCat videos - it's a good intro. I don't have to understand everything here right now
1. Course https://github.com/RPISEC/MBE
2. Collect questions
3. If the question concearns assembly - check Arch1001
4. Question about memory or bin - check binary analysis or computer systems
5. Check tools and examples from kpi slides
6. Read binary analysis


## Books from the course
- Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition by Jon Erickson  
- The Shellcoder's Handbook: Discovering and Exploiting Security Holes  

## Extra
- [MIT](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2020/schedule.html) xv6 from the reverse point of view
- Once a month CTFs with reverse tasks
