## Gratitude that doesn't work

Ok, I want to admit that I really hated gratitude practice. 

Everytime, I sat down with my notebook and started to think about 3 things that I'm greateful for.

Umm...I'm greateful for the breakfast, which I'm eating the same everyday for few month already. What else? Ok, I'm thankful my coach for the training, where I almost died. Aaah here...I'm thankful my gym for the sauna, at least they switching it on.

Actually this is not so cool as probably it suppose to be. And it sertainly not genuine. At least from my point of view. I did that few days and dropped it. 

But, everything changed when I found Huberman's podcast about gratitude routine. And I thought wow, Andrew doing this boring, unfulfilling gratitude practice, I definately should hear that. Maybe he'll inspire me with some examples. 

And you know what? 

**This whole gratitude routine was wrong!**

Remember that feelings when somebody say thanks to you from the whole heart?

_"You're inspiring me"_  
_"I thought this is a dead end, but you've pointed me the solution. Thank you!"_  
_"You're asking me so simple questions and I see how the whole world is changing when I'm trying to answer them"_  

You see? Much better. This is mine thanks, yours would be other. But you get the point.

The gratitude practice is a practice when you are reminding yourself about gratitude, which was given to you!

It's about power, it's about joy, it's about inspiration, positive emotions.

How?

## The true gratitude practice

1. Find the story, when you were given a genuine thanks
2. You don't have to write it fully, just summarize

    **What the struggle was and how I feel before the receiving thanks?  
    How I helped that person?  
    How "Thanks" empacted me emotionally?**  

Actually this should not be your own story, you can use the story which inspires you. But it definately should be a story about receiving thanks, not giving.


And... actually it gives me an idea how business works, instagram works and other social connections. I'm doing something for you. You're so happy about it and giving me a heartful thanks (or money with thanks). I'm fullfilling with positive energy and doing that even more. 

**Don't be alone. Do something for other people. They will give it back.**
