description: From Embedded Systems to Software Architecture - My Journey Back to Development
---

After a few years wandering through different roles â€” from low-level programming and reverse engineering to product and project management â€” Iâ€™ve decided to return to my old passion: **software development**.

Most of my experience lies in **high-level embedded systems** â€” primarily Embedded Linux and the AUTOSAR framework. This means Iâ€™m not a fit for projects involving ESP32, STM microcontrollers, or Linux kernel development. Frankly, Iâ€™m not interested in going back to that niche, and thatâ€™s one of the reasons my career exploration took so long.

Recently, Iâ€™ve been researching a new direction â€” **software and solution architecture**.
But before I get there, I want to strengthen my base by building real projects using **Python, Go**, and **TypeScript**. My goal is to first work as a *full-stack developer*, and then grow into a *technical lead* or **architect**.

## The Knowledge Ladder: From Developer to Architect

To clarify my learning path, Iâ€™ve broken down the knowledge areas and responsibilities into four levels:

| Level       | Name            | Who is responsible      | Examples    |
| ----------- | --------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| ðŸ”¹ **1. System architecture** | Solution Architecture | Architectors, Tech Leads  | Layered, Microservices, Event-Driven, Serverless   |
| ðŸ”¹ **2. App architecture / enterprise** | Enterprise Patterns | Senior devs, Architectors | MVC, MVVM, Domain Model, Repository, Service Layer |
| ðŸ”¹ **3. Design Patterns (GoF)** | Design Patterns  | Developers   | Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, Decorator  |
| ðŸ”¹ **4. Idioms / coding techniques**   | Idioms, Language Patterns | Developers | Optional, try-with-resources, builder chaining     |

## How These Levels Work Together
Let me show you an example.

Suppose we decide to build a **layered architecture** with data, business, and presentation layers, and deploy it **on-premise**.
Thatâ€™s **system architecture**. Here, we could also define an AWS-based design if it were a cloud project.

Next, we move deeper into **application architecture**: for instance, choosing MVC for the presentation layer. This decision could be made by an architect or a senior developer. In my experience, it was often a senior developerâ€™s call.

After that, the senior dev splits the system into smaller work chunks and assigns them to mid-level developers. Each developer designs their piece using **design patterns**.

Finally, when coding begins, developers apply **idioms** and language-specific techniques to write clean, maintainable code.

## Skills Needed at Each Stage

To grow from a mid-level developer to a senior developer â€” and eventually to an architect â€” you need to:

1. **Code well** â€” know the language, its syntax, and best practices.
2. **Design at the class level** â€” apply design patterns effectively.
3. **Organize code into an application** â€” choose and implement app architecture.
4. **Understand system architecture** â€” see how multiple applications form a larger infrastructure.

## My Current Status

**Strengths:** Design patterns. I naturally think about them during the design phase, before coding.
**Weaknesses:** Deep language-specific knowledge (Python, Go, TypeScript).
**Current Reading:** Software Architecture Fundamentals â€” covering Level 1 (System Architecture).
**Gap:** Enterprise patterns (Level 2) â€” something Iâ€™ve largely missed so far.

## A New Learning Season

With this article, Iâ€™m officially starting a *new learning season*.
My goal for the coming months is to:

- **Master Python** for backend development and general coding.
- **Learn React** to handle modern frontend work.
- **Practice integrating code into full software architecture** so the system is maintainable and scalable.
- **Explore AWS services** and understand how to connect them to my applications â€” from deployment to monitoring.

By combining coding skills, architectural thinking, and cloud integration, I want to move *vconfidently into the full-stack and architecture space.**
