## 2024 Strategy

I decided that I really want to officially get a cyber security education but I need money for that. 
So I have to apply as a developer this year.

I don't want to change my specialization, so I remain a C developer. However, I do want to upgrade my networking and driver development knowledge.
So for the first Q1 and Q2 I will learn networking CCNA (Q1) and write a driver (Q2) for an ethernet device (xv6 course from MIT).

### Q1
Finish Cisco prep by March 29  
Free time: Try hack me + reverse just for fun

### Q2
Find a job as a C programmer, preferably with a networking stack
Learn and write a driver to ethernet device (see xv6 OS MIT course)

Free time: Try hack me + reverse just for fun

Collect answers to the question: should I pass school exams to apply to the UNI or my Master's diploma would be enough to have only the enter interview.

### Q3
For this time I have to start with my learning at the University  
Have a job as a middle-C developer  
Have a CCNA certification and a driver in the portfolio  

Free time: Hack The Box

### Q4
Relax and enjoy the prepared university schedule for me

Free time: Hack The Box
