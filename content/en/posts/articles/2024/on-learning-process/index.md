## Little note on the learning process

This is a small note about the approach used by little Hexxie in childhood to do programming without deep programming knowledge (yeah, I've started to learn (if I can say this loud word) programming since 12). 

So the trick is - to identify your end goal. Ask yourself what you wanna do with that new skill you want to learn? 

This is forgotten knowledge because a lot of years after I've just learned, because... you know... I have to pass a job interview. But, please, forget the interview. Your dream job will find you anyway. 

Let's focus on what you wanna build? Or perhaps research? 

For example, 

I want to do reverse and Pwn challenges faster in CTF contests.  
I want to do malware analysis.  
I want to create a web application for my business.  
I want to work with routers as a software engineer, so I want to learn how they work.  
I want to write a linux driver.

Now, take your goal and try do to this. Stop thinking like I don't have skills, I have to learn assembly, OS, databases, etc. 

Just take your goal and go try it. Search for videos, articles, books - exactly about that goal. Watch how other people doing, imitate. Your brain will guide you on what you need to learn extra. 

But! You have to stick to your end goal. This extra knowledge you'd want to get should not become your end goal. Try to stick to your "I want" at least once a week. You'll see the progress sooner or later.

But if you go for the extra knowledge without checking with your goal, you'll never achieve it. 

Little Hexxie was wiser than adult Hexxie. That's why adult Hexxie is a software developer now but not an engineer.
