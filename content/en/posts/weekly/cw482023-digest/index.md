description: List of materials that I've learned this week

It seems that when I'm talking to myself in front of my camera I make better plans. At least it seems it's like a commitment to some kind of manager. Its manager is me.

Actually, I've tried to record some stories for Instagram, but it seems I'm too shy to share them. But the commitment worked pretty well.

## ReshShuffler

I've finished the first MVP version. 
Right now I can use it with my telegram. 
I've installed a web server into my Raspberry as a service

Here's a [repo](https://github.com/Hexxie/RestShuffler) to it. I wanted to finish MVP by December and I did that. I'll create a Readme for it during December.

And here's [how to create a service for Linux](https://hexxie.github.io/posts/how-to-create-linux-service/). Just a small note to myself. It's that simple to run any linux cycled software on the background with this feature. 

For now, it's done. I'll continue when I'll have some inspiration.

## Advent of Everything

So...I'm unemployed and ready to complete all the tasks that I've always dreamed of completing when I was employed.

For example [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

And [AdventOfCyber](https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber2023)

And Advent of chocolate of course.

## Future Plans

So...the first part of my week was - RestShuffler.
The second part is advents of everything and a bit of reflection.

I decided to move into the cybersecurity journey. I've started to investigate this path since the end of October. I've taken part in Huntress Month and Sunshine CTF (that was actually really bad).

I've finished the beginner path of HackTheBox tutorials. And...it seems I really like it. I'd say I have skills that help me to create some assumptions to hack the machines or investigate code. 

Next year I want to get CCNA and OSCP certifications, then...we'll see whether this really helps to get the desired job.
