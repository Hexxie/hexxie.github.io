## 2024 Strategy

Right now I have two paths - develop myself as a penetration tester for the next year or learn to analyze malware.  

Also I want to actively participate in CTFs as a Reverse engineer. So... a lot of self-development and new content here in the blog. 

## Penetration testing frameworks

1. OSSTMM [The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf) - penetration testing of networks   
2. owasp [Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/)- testing of web applications  
3. NIST(Â [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)) - to improve cybersec standards and manage risks  
4. CAF - asses risk and defences [Cyber Assessment Framework](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/caf/caf-principles-and-guidance)  

Mostly I've used TryHackMe to learn penetration testing and worked on the new vision for 2024. 

## Planned articles:
- Materials to learn reverse engineer
- Tools for directories enumeration

# Happy New Year 2024!
