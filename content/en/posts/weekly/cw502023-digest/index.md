## TryHackMe Side Quests investigation

This week mostly worked with side quests on TryHackMe. This topic is getting hot for me. Even paid for a subscription - I realized that I've never seen Active Directory before.

### SQ1

- Get SSID and password from pcap via HashCat

### SQ2

Found QR code from the game: to be precise - draw it via java.  
I'll share the source code after Dec 27

### SQ3

- Learning about Active Directory
