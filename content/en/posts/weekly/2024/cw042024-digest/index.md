Not much updates here. Routinely doing CCNA prep. Removed Instagram from my phone, so now I have the time for Baldur's Gate 3. BTW check this [Larian thread](https://forums.larian.com/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=927734&page=5) for the history purposes. They unable to provide fix for 2 months already. 

Their dirty fix is - upload all saves into their cloud and each time when I enter the game saves have been downloading from there. I've never met such bugs in the other games before. Why?

### CCNA Progress

Currently: Day 14 - Subnetting
