This week I'm working mostly with React and Design from scratch for my future app. Hope it'll be successful.

## Rest API

What was behind the Rest design? It could help me to think about how to design mine.

## Front-end

### JavaScript 

The best [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHhi8ymDMrQaJkE8AsD1mR4aHnobVfk3A) for JavaScript [UA]. It's like the University again and for free.
And more tutorials from the same professor are [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHhi8ymDMrQZad6JDh6HRzY1Wz5WB34w0).

### React

## Back-end 

### Databases

[How databases work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztHopE5Wnpc&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) 8 hours of content.  
[Database Design examples](https://web.archive.org/web/20210508051645/http://www.databaseanswers.org/data_models/index_all_models.htm). This is a real treasure. Check it.

## CV 

Modern CV. [Software Developer edition](https://resume.io/uk/blog/why-you-need-a-personal-profile-cv). I think after this tutorial I'll be ready to fill up my About section.
