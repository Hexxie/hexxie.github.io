description: List of materials that I've learned this week
---

To be precise, this is the collection of the materials that I've learned during 3 weeks, not only one. I was a bit lazy to create this summary. Feels like a small vacation :)

## TryHackMe
- Currently, I continue with learning the Jr Penetration Tester path. Just for fun. Things which I've passed so far (I can't say that I've learned because I don't think that I manage to do this without guidance). These topics I'd probably learn in the future and create separate articles:
    - SSRF
    - XSS
    - LFI
    - SQL Injection
- Burp
- Right now I'm continuing to learn active reconnaissance. I already have an [article](https://hexxie.github.io/posts/articles/reconnaissance-with-nmap/) for this. But probably I'll write the second part - I've gathered a lot of information about Nmap.

## CCNA
### CCNA learning approach

1. Course [Free CCNA](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ) with flashcards and labs
2. Labs from Odom Wendell on [certSkills](https://blog.certskills.com/category/200-301-v1-parts/)
3. [Official CCNA guide](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ccna-200-301-official/9780136755562/vol1_ch01.xhtml)

Books:
1. [Computer Networking: Top Down Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Networking-Top-Down-Approach-7th/dp/0133594149)
2. [Computer Networks: A system approach](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Networks-Approach-Kaufmann-Networking/dp/0128182008/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3G8IS728IYHX3&keywords=computer+networks+a+systems+approach&qid=1705588069&s=books&sprefix=computer+networks+s%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C179&sr=1-1)


Deadline: March 29
Goal: Connect Cisco certification knowledge with development knowledge

This would be my personal network achievement. So I really do want to finish this. 

### Current Progress
- Day 7 of the course  
- Networking the top-down approach: finished 1st chapter

## Reverse Engineering
### Typical tasks

1. Rewrite local variable
2. Return to other function (with or without params)

### The Strategy
0. Get in touch with CryproCat videos - like a good intro. I don't have to understand everything here right now
1. Course https://github.com/RPISEC/MBE
2. Collect questions
3. If the question concerns assembly - check Arch1001
4. Question about memory or bin - check binary analysis or computer systems
5. Check tools and examples from KPI slides
6. Read binary analysis

## Communications

Found the link with [resources for social engineering](https://github.com/giuliacassara/awesome-social-engineering). It seems if I'll search that books I'll find the ruler of effective communication. I almost prepared an article with this. Really excited.
