description: List of materials which I've learned this week
---

It appears that I don't do what I need to do because I don't want to. I've noticed that when I created my new diet based on new Huberman Lab resources about appetite I just chaotically experiment with tools and created the plan which right now serves me well. So I planned that I'll create an article here with my analysis about appetite. But actually I didn't analyze anything. And even more...I don't want just rephrase Huberman in my own words, since I'm not that professional to do so.

So what did I do this week except my famous procrastination on things I didn't want to do at all. 

## Python bot and Unit tests

Last week I worked on my Python Bot (currently It's only a python script) to help me randomly choose particular kind of rest which can increase my dopamin level in unpredictable way. 

You can check [the video](https://youtu.be/QmOF0crdyRU?si=KFpnNufN7xjQ7xmY) here why I want to increase my dopamine randomly.

I've read a book related to pyTest, which I've never used before. [And here are my notes](https://hexxie.github.io/posts/unit-tests-strategy/) from there. I'd say this is my favourite topic about test planning to read about, because it feels like unit tests it's an endless story to me. That's why I hate them so much.

## Interviews

I have to start for searching a new job...hopefully next year. But I like to be fully prepared for this. So... here's the resource to prep myself, I don't thinks that I have to work so hard for local companies as this guide offers, but advice there is actually pretty good.

## Python again

Well...I always forget how to create venv. Even more...venv for Windows is slightly different. I have some notes for this. I'll post it tomorrow and update this digest accordingly.  


## Youtube videos for self-development

### Appetite

This is actually that video about appetite. Unfortunately I've found it too late. I've already created my nutrition plan and executing it for 3 weeks. But...with this information everything makes more sense to me. So If you really struggling with handling your appetite - I'd definately reccomend this

### Cleaning Habit

This was unexpected. Actually I felt really angry that my flat was so messy this week. And I just thought why others apartments are so clean. And, you know, others have biiiiiig houses. Much more bigger than our flat. So how they are keeping everything in order. And the answer is - cleaning routine.

### Sugar

Yeeah, nutrition again. It's my top prio topic this month. I hope I'll come with this topic and what I take from it for myself. In short. Sugar is not a death. But there's no healthy stuff in it too. I would say: you want it - you eat it. But here's the tools how to reduce sugar consumption https://youtu.be/VAEzZeaV5zM?si=1-qLEdkTCXkvrima
