## Python OOP

Posted my notes with [Basic Python OOP](https://hexxie.github.io/posts/python_attributes_basic/) info. 

## SQL Databases and Python

So Python has an alternative for Singletone - it's Global Object Pattern.  
[More info here.](https://python-patterns.guide)  

And this pattern could be used to establish a connection with the database. So what I did in my last [commit for RestShuffler](https://github.com/Hexxie/RestShuffler/commit/0b7f52ae7968cb8425bc305bd260ff4038dcc219#diff-5219b8e3c623be6cc1fa55acb025ebc52f832bb7dcaa16d8b8168d4a00161190)

Also, reviewed some sql code with chatGPT.  
For example this notation:
{{< highlight python >}}
cur.executemany("INSERT INTO test VALUES(?, ?)", values)
{{< /highlight >}}
I didn't know that we can use `?` instead column names. I'll create a note about that this week. 

## C++ Code review Video

Interesting thing: .hpp headers are created to specify that this is C++ header, and prevent from C-compiler

## Prep for Winter Cybersec advent

I want to take part in this event https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber2023  
I already registered there, waiting for the 1st Dec. 

Also this looks interesting as well https://www.sans.org/mlp/holiday-hack-challenge-2023/  
This week I'd like to work on some security stuff. 

## Gratitude practice

[Huberman's Protocol](https://youtu.be/KVjfFN89qvQ?t=4747):
1. The practice should be grounded into the story (What that story was?)
2. Story should be about: I receiving genualy (wholeheartedly) thanks (not giving!!!)
3. I'm observing someone else receiving thanks or expressing (genuinely)
4. Write down few bulletpoints that reminds that story for me: state that I were in when I received the gratitude, the state that I were in after receiving the gratitude and emotions of the story

And my notes gathered [here](https://hexxie.github.io/posts/gratitude-that-works/).

## Pronunciation

Google can help with learning pronunciation. Just search for how to pronounce word

Example:
```
how to pronounce genuinely
```

And it'll open a form where you can record your pronunciation and get feedback with recommendations.

**Consistency is key.**
