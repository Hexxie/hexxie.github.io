## 1. NutriForge
I’m working on **NutriForge** — a startup that aims to make meal planning smarter and more personalized through automation.  
Right now, I’m focused on designing the MVP, exploring product architecture, and deciding how to best integrate cloud services for scalability.  
My main challenges are balancing technical development with user research.

## 2. Growing as a Solution Architect
My primary learning focus is **solution architecture** — building scalable, maintainable systems from the ground up.  
I’m currently deep-diving into:
- **Architecture patterns** and system design principles
- **AWS** and **Google Cloud** for deployment and scaling
- Best practices for connecting technical decisions with business goals
