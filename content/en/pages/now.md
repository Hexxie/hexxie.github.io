Updated June 17th, 2024, from my home in Ukraine.  

## 1. NutriForge

Right now I'm participiting in Ukrainian Startup School with my future meal planner. I called it NutriForge for now. 

My biggest challenges are: marketing and MVP. 

## 2. Becoming Product Manager
I've finished the course on Product Management. Right now I'm seriously considering to try this specialization commercially.

I've applied to Genesis Product School. Now I'm in the 2nd stage of aplication. 


## 3. Communication skills

I want to be heard, so I created a strategy to build up my storytelling and small-talk skills.

### Storytelling
1. Analyze stories based on the story circle (Storyworthy, On writing Steven's King)
2. Finish storyworthy (and create an article with new techniques)
3. Create few stories about myself based on Story circle
4. Tell this stories to my phone, then to my husbend, then into instagram 
5. Evaluate progress and create next steps'

### Small talk
1. Skimm questions before the events where small talk could appear (maybe copy it into the phone)
2. If I am in the event - go and ask, even if it so scary
3. When I feel more comfortable, describe all of this in form of the story 
4. At home: spend 5-10 minutes playing communication loop with myself. I can use question generator or noun generator. 

Extra: Small talk learning it's a good opportunity for story **Triumph against distress**
