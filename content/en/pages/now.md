Updated February 11th, 2024, from my home in Ukraine.  

## Cisco CCNA certification

Right now I'm focusing on passing Cisco CCNA certifications. Actually, this is the 2nd attempt to do this. The first part was in 2021. I took some Ukrainian courses for this and failed because the target audience was system administrators, which I'm not part of. 

This attempt would be self-learned with a focus on questions that I have as a software engineer, not a network administrator. I need deeper knowledge, of how it works from the coding perspective, not only conceptional. 

### Resources:
- Jeremy McDowell: CCNA Exam

## Reverse engineering

Currently, this is my hobby. I like to take a binary and analyze how it stores and retrieves information in a stack. Also, I'm trying to take part in CTFs (Reverse/PWN section). 

This is a large topic and I'm not rushing. Just having fun and learning.
