Updated February 11th, 2024, from my home in Ukraine.  

## 1. Cisco CCNA certification

Right now I'm focusing on passing Cisco CCNA certifications. Actually, this is the 2nd attempt to do this. The first part was in 2021. I took some Ukrainian courses for this and failed because the target audience was system administrators, which I'm not part of. 

This attempt would be self-learned with a focus on questions that I have as a software engineer, not a network administrator. I need deeper knowledge, of how it works from the coding perspective, not only conceptional. 

### Resources:

## 2. Reverse engineering

Currently, this is my hobby. I like to take a binary and analyze how it stores and retrieves information in a stack. Also, I'm trying to take part in CTFs (Reverse/PWN section). 

This is a large topic and I'm not rushing. Just having fun and learning.

## 3. Communication skills

I want to be heard, so I created a strategy to build up my storytelling and small-talk skills.

### Storytelling
1. Analyze stories based on the story circle (Storyworthy, On writing Steven's King)
2. Finish storyworthy (and create an article with new techniques)
3. Create few stories about myself based on Story circle
4. Tell this stories to my phone, then to my husbend, then into instagram 
5. Evaluate progress and create next steps'

### Small talk
1. Skimm questions before the events where small talk could appear (maybe copy it into the phone)
2. If I am in the event - go and ask, even if it so scary
3. When I feel more comfortable, describe all of this in form of the story 
4. At home: spend 5-10 minutes playing communication loop with myself. I can use question generator or noun generator. 

Extra: Small talk learning it's a good opportunity for story **Triumph against distress**
