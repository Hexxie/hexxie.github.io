## 1. Meal Planner app

I've found the idea that I need to create a startup. At least I have to try once in my life. And now - it's time. I have a big idea, with a lot of small features. Now I'm working on MVC, so I can't provide you with details. I need to learn React and Django for this. Quite a challenging task for System Programmer. And I love challenges. Hope they love me too. 


## 2. Communication skills

I want to be heard, so I created a strategy to build up my storytelling and small-talk skills.

### Storytelling
1. Analyze stories based on the story circle (Storyworthy, On writing Steven's King)
2. Finish storyworthy (and create an article with new techniques)
3. Create few stories about myself based on Story circle
4. Tell this stories to my phone, then to my husbend, then into instagram 
5. Evaluate progress and create next steps'

### Small talk
1. Skimm questions before the events where small talk could appear (maybe copy it into the phone)
2. If I am in the event - go and ask, even if it so scary
3. When I feel more comfortable, describe all of this in form of the story 
4. At home: spend 5-10 minutes playing communication loop with myself. I can use question generator or noun generator. 

Extra: Small talk learning it's a good opportunity for story **Triumph against distress**
