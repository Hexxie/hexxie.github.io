## Hi there! I'm Anastasiia Rusak. 

### From Software Developer to Product Manager
Since 2016, I've been dedicated to software development, specializing in support tools for embedded devices and the automotive field. Now, I'm transitioning into a Product Manager role, bringing a unique blend of technical expertise and managerial insight.

### My Expertise and Interests
My main commercial expertise lies in developing support tools for embedded devices and the automotive field. For fun, I create Telegram bots using the Python+Django stack and enjoy participating in CTF challenges as a reverse engineer.

### So why should you read me?
- I’m a lifelong learner and want to share my observations with you.
- I’m not afraid to try new things, from reverse engineering to machine Learning.
- I want to show you managerial concepts from a programmer’s perspective and explain why management and sales are important for us programmers.


## Current Focus: Meal Automation
With a Master's degree in automation and computer-integrated technologies, I've decided to merge my technical knowledge and passion for healthy living. My latest project aims to streamline meal planning and promote healthy eating habits through automation. After all, feeling good is the ultimate goal of our efforts in work and life.
