## Hi there! Iâ€™m Anastasiia Rusak.

### From Software Developer to Solution Architect in Progress
Since 2016, Iâ€™ve been in software development, working on everything from low-level systems to full-stack applications.  
Today, my main focus is developing skills for **solution architecture** â€” designing scalable, maintainable, and efficient systems, and learning how to deploy them on **AWS** and **Google Cloud**.

### My Expertise and Interests
- **Solution architecture & system design** â€” currently my main learning and growth area.
- **Side projects** â€” building tools and experiments, often with Python.
- **Reverse engineering & CTF challenges** â€” solving puzzles and exploring how systems work.
- **Cloud technologies** â€” hands-on experiments with AWS and GCP.

In the past, I specialized in **embedded systems and automotive support tools**, but Iâ€™ve shifted my focus toward higher-level architecture and system design.

### A bit about me
Iâ€™ve been programming since I was 12, and Iâ€™m most excited when Iâ€™m solving problems, experimenting with new ideas, and figuring out how things work under the hood.

Outside of tech, I enjoy weightlifting and exploring how physical performance connects with mental productivity.

### Current Focus: NutriForge
Right now, Iâ€™m building **NutriForge** â€” a project that merges my technical skills with my interest in healthy living.  
The goal: automate meal planning and make nutrition more personalized and efficient.
